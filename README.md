### Chat-analyzer

Chat-analyzer is an early prototype for a web application that allows a user to connect to a twitch stream. After connecting
to the stream, incoming chat messages are aggregated and sent into a LLM for insights into what is being discussed in the chat.

These insights can help inform a live stream about the topics their live chat is discussing, the sentitments about the topic, and a more detailed
description of the topic to give context.
